# rapscore
Rapscore was our foundation project at Holberton's Programming School. This project proposed a workforce based credit system, implementing technology and performance. The main goal was to facilitate fast loan access to workers based on their performance.

<br>The project backend was written in Python. We used MySQL as relational database management system and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
