# rapscore
Rapscore is our foundations project inside Holberton School. This project proposes a workforce based credit system, implementing technology and performance. The main goal is to facilitate fast loan access to workers based on their performance.

The project built-in languages are Python for APIs calls (RESTful) and MySQL connection database management. HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript were used for the web framework deployment. This was a 3 weeks project.
