# about lh1008

<br>As a software engineer, I'm passionate for building our present. For the past 2 years, I have contributed to the open-source <a href="https://web.getmonero.org/" target="_blank">Monero Project</a>. Monero, is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency project led by volunteers that grabbed my attention to the digital world. Inside the Monero community I role as the Communication Workgroup Coordinator for the <a href="https://www.monerooutreach.org/" target="_blank">Monero Outreach Workgroup</a>, coordinating translations, transcriptions, and posting updated workgroup news.

<br>Before volunteering in Monero, I was an entrepreneur. Being an entrepenuer motivated me to follow my dreams in software engineering. I always wanted to create my own website and integrate a cryptocurrency payment gateway but technology was an obstacle. I joined <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com/" target="_blank">Holberton School</a> to learn to code and develop the technical skills I was looking for.

<br>I'm challenge motivated. When I see a task that has to be completed, I listen to the issue, gather all the information, and put myself to work. When I work with a team I like to hear my team's ideas, learn from what they say, give a structure, and openly collaborate.

<br>If you would like to talk with me, send me a <a href="/contact">/contact</a> message.
