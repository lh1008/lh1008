# about lh1008

<br>For the past 3 years, I have contributed to the open-source <a href="https://web.getmonero.org/" target="_blank">Monero Project</a>. Monero is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency project led by volunteers. Inside the Monero community I role as the Communication Workgroup Coordinator for the <a href="https://www.monerooutreach.org/" target="_blank">Monero Outreach Workgroup</a>. My main tasks are to lead the localization workgroup and as SysOps server maintainer.

<br>Iâ€™ve always been an entrepreneur. What motivates me to be an entrepreneur is to work hard for a better world for the people around me. I started my software engineer career at <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com/" target="_blank">Holberton School</a> with my main objective to understand the technology behing Monero.

<br>I'm challenge motivated and a very disciplined person.
