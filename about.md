# about lh1008

<br>As a software engineer, I'm passionate for building our present. For the past 2 years, I have contributed to the open-source [Monero Project](https://web.getmonero.org/). Monero, is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency volunteer-led project that involved me with digital technology.

<br>Before volunteering in Monero, I worked as an entrepreneur in my own business. That experience was what motivated me to follow my dreams in software engineering. I always wanted to create my own website and integrate a cryptocurrency payment gateway but I always had the technology obstacle. I joined [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/) because I saw the opportunity to learn to code and help build a better world.

<br>My latest project is a [Telegram bot](https://repo.getmonero.org/lh1008/monerojobsbot) written in Python programming language that welcomes new users once they enter a chat room. I'm most fluent in the Python programming language and feel comfortable working with it. You can check all the projects I have contributed to in my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/lh1008/).

<br>I'm challenge motivated. When I see a task that has to be completed, I listen to the issue, gather all the information and put myself to work. When I work with a team I like to hear my team's ideas, learn from what they say, give them a structure, and collaborate with them.
