# about lh1008

<br>For the past 7 years, I have contributed to the open-source <a href="https://web.getmonero.org/" target="_blank">Monero Project</a> in different areas. Monero is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency project led by volunteers. I roled as the Communication Workgroup Coordinator for the <a href="https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/outreach-docs" target="_blank">Monero Outreach Workgroup</a> and I'm currently handling some social media related to Monero Outreach. In the Monero Outreach Workgroup my maind tasks were to lead the localization workgroup and as junior IT server maintainer.

<br>Iâ€™ve always been an entrepreneur. What motivates me to be an entrepreneur is to work hard for a better world for the people around me. I started my software engineer career at <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com/" target="_blank">Holberton School</a> with my main objective to understand the technology behing Monero.

<br>I'm currently expanding my software engineering expertise. I'm currently working at [Addi](https://co.addi.com/) as **Support Engineer**. I'm a very challenge motivated person and very disciplined. I really like to learn new things.
