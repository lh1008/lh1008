### Personal Website

Welcome to my personal repository project for my website dedicated to my profile as a Software Engineer. The jekyll theme designed I chose for my personal site remembered me the GNU/Linux terminal.

Decided to leave the white version of it because it gave it light to what I expected to be. Is a very simple design but powerful in its core.
